Test completions

This command can be used to test that your completions script responds with the
right completions. It works by reading your completely.yaml file, generating a
completions script, and generating a temporary testing script.

Usage:
  completely test [--keep] COMPLINE
  completely test (-h|--help)

Options:
  -k --keep
    Keep the temporary testing script in the current directory

  -h --help
    Show this help

Parameters:
  COMPLINE
    The command to test completions for. This will be handled as if a TAB was
    pressed immediately at the end of it, so the last word is considered the
    active cursor. If you wish to complete for the next word instead, end your
    command with a space.

Environment Variables:
  COMPLETELY_CONFIG_PATH
    Path to a completely configuration file [default: completely.yaml]

  COMPLETELY_DEBUG
    It not empty, the generated script will include an additional debugging
    snippet that outputs the compline and current word to a text file when a
    completion is requested

Examples:
  completely test "mygit pu"
  completely test "mygit pull "
