Test completions

This command can be used to test that any completion script (either generated by
compeltely or not) responds with the right completions.

In order to test on a completely configuration file other than
'completely.yaml', set the COMPLETELY_CONFIG_PATH environemnt variable.

In order to test on an arbitrary completions script, set the
COMPLETELY_SCRIPT_PATH and optionally the COMPLETELY_SCRIPT_FUNCTION environment
variables.

Usage:
  completely test COMPLINE
  completely test (-h|--help)

Options:
  -h --help
    Show this help

Parameters:
  COMPLINE
    The command to test completions for. This will be handled as if a TAB was
    pressed immediately at the end of it, so the last word is considered the
    active cursor. If you wish to complete for the next word instead, end your
    command with a space.

Environment Variables:
  COMPLETELY_CONFIG_PATH
    Path to a completely configuration file [default: completely.yaml]

  COMPLETELY_SCRIPT_PATH
    Path to a completions script. When set, this script will be tested instead
    of the completely configuration file

  COMPLETELY_SCRIPT_FUNCTION
    The main completion function to call when using a custom script. If not set,
    the basename of the script path will be used, prefixed by an underscore

  COMPLETELY_DEBUG
    It not empty, the generated script will include an additional debugging
    snippet that outputs the compline and current word to a text file when a
    completion is requested

Examples:
  completely test "mygit pu"
  completely test "mygit pull "
  COMPLETELY_SCRIPT_PATH=/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/chown \
    completely test "chown --"
